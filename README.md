PROBLEM DESCRIPTION - The process, defined as ‘risk-based pricing’, uses a sophisticated algorithm that leverages different determining factors of a loan applicant. Selection of significant factors will help develop a prediction algorithm which can estimate loan interest rates based on clients’ information. On one hand, knowing the factors will help consumers and borrowers to increase their credit worthiness and place themselves in a better position to negotiate for getting a lower interest rate. On the other hand, this will help lending companies to get an immediate fixed interest rate estimation based on clients information.
Around 8100+ participants registered in the same, and I would want to lay down my approach and learnings through this repository.
It was quite interesting and close to a real-world problem, and that’s the reason it grabbed my attention. It was a multinomial classification problem, and each loan application would have to be categorized into a class of interest rates( 3 in total) based on attributes like Loan amount, no. of employment years, Homeowner status, annual income, etc.
Approach
1. Read data
2. Explore data, prepare data summary, check for missing values, outliers etc
3. Treat missing values
4. Perform EDA
5. Model building
6. Further improvements
